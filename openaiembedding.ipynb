Niiden kulutus on nopeassa kasvussa, mutta ongelmana on, ettÃ¤ lÃ¤hes 80 prosenttia kuitukankaista on valmistettu Ã¶ljypohjaisista materiaaleista. Teknologian tutkimuskeskus VTT on kehittÃ¤nyt JyvÃ¤skylÃ¤ssÃ¤ uusia valmistusmenetelmiÃ¤, joilla kuitukankaiden fossiiliriippuvuutta pystyttÃ¤isiin vÃ¤hentÃ¤mÃ¤Ã¤n merkittÃ¤vÃ¤sti. VTT:n Koivurannassa sijaitsevissa tiloissa toimii pilottilinja, jossa hyÃ¶dynnetÃ¤Ã¤n suomalaisia raaka-aineita, sellukuitua ja tekstiilikuituja, vedenkulutusta minimoivan sekÃ¤ energiatehokkaan vaahtoteknologian avulla. Sampoksi nimetty vaahtorainauskoekone muistuttaa paperikonetta. Paperin sijasta linjalta valmistuu kuitukankaita. Vaaahtorainauksessa kuitumateriaali muodostetaan erityisen vesivaahdon avulla. Sopiva vaahto saadaan sekoittamalla vettÃ¤, vaahdotusainetta sekÃ¤ kuituraaka-aineita. Tilaa digi ja pÃ¤Ã¤set lukemaan kaikki Keskisuomalaisen sisÃ¤llÃ¶t.
